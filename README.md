Enabling Cross Origin Requests for a RESTful Web Service (Spring Guide)

## What is CORS?
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.
A web page may freely embed cross-origin images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and videos. Certain "cross-domain" requests, notably Ajax requests, are forbidden by default by the same-origin security policy. CORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request.It allows for more freedom and functionality than purely same-origin requests, but is more secure than simply allowing all cross-origin requests.
